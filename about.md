-I like to video games in general. My current wife is Dell XPS 15 9550 with a NVIDIA GTX 960M and a i7-6770HQ. Not the best thing in the world... But I still love her <span class="image"><img src="{{ "/images/heart.png" | absolute_url }}" width="10" height="10" alt="" /></span>

    →Enter the Gungeon
    →Hollow Knight
    →Ori and the Blind Forest
    →Ratchet and Clank (Pretty much any installment of the franchise)
    →Hearthstone


-I have to <b>seriously work on some side projects for job reasons</b>, as shown by this website

-I love problem solving and figuring things out by myself

-I have no girlfriend (surprise surprise)
