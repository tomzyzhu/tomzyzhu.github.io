A project constructed from APIs at Hack the North 2018, a hackathon at Waterloo, Ontario. Uses OpenCV to project and save images, which sent to an image recognition AI in the IBM Watson Cloud. The intent was to implement this software to provide a good way to send a text to one's phone when someone uses one's doorbell or when something triggers a motion sensor, as well as providing an image and an AI produced suggestion of who it is at the door. No actual product exists, only the working project files.
