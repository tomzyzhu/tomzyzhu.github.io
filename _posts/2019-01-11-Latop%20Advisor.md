Application generates suggestions on which laptops to buy based on user inputted data. Sorts and displays the 3 most suggested laptops based on a Weight Decision Matrix.

Was a team project with a couple of high school peers. I handled most of the information processing and logic, as well as designed the introduction, credits, menu bar, and suggestions report JFrames.
